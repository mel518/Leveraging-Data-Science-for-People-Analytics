This project uses Python to analyze employee data to identify company trends like pay equity, attrition factors, and correlated features. It then uses the company data set to fit a model that predicts employee performance ratings based on available features.

Pay Equity

Pay equity is the fair and equitable treatment in the workplace in regard to compensation and benefits. It is important to ensure that all employees are paid fairly, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or other factors. It is important to regularly check for pay equity as discrepencies can evolve unintentionally within a company. 

To identify pay equity trends, this project will use Python to analyze employee data such as salary, raises, and stock option. This project looks for patterns in the data that suggests whether males or females are being financially prioritized.

Attrition Factors

Attrition, also known as employee turnover, is the loss of employees from a company. It is a costly problem for companies, as it can lead to decreased productivity, increased costs, and a loss of knowledge and expertise.

To identify attrition factors, this project will use Python to analyze employee data such as income, department, education, role, and gender. This project looks for patterns in the data that suggest that certain groups of employees are more likely to leave the company.

Correlated Features

Correlated features are features in a dataset that are related to each other. For example, job title and salary are correlated features, as employees with higher job titles typically earn more money.

To identify correlated features, this project will use Python to calculate the correlation matrix of the employee data set. The correlation matrix shows the correlation between all pairs of features in the data set.

Predicting Employee Performance Ratings

Employee performance ratings are a measure of how well an employee is performing their job, typically designated by their manager. They are used for a variety of purposes, such as making promotion decisions, setting compensation, and measuring goal completion.

To predict employee performance ratings, this project will use Python to fit a machine learning model to the employee data set. The model will be trained on the data set and then used to predict the performance ratings of new employees.

This project is relevant to corporate America because it can help companies to:

1. Identify and address pay equity issues.
2. Reduce employee turnover.
3. Improve employee performance.

Pay equity is important because it is fair and equitable. It also helps to attract and retain top talent. Attrition is a costly problem for companies, so reducing attrition can save companies money. Improving employee performance can lead to increased productivity and profits.

Data science in HR empowers companies to be more efficient and in tune with the state of their workforce.
